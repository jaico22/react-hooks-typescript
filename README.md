## Motivation
There are a lot of examples of how to use hooks in react in typescript, but quite frankly, a lot of them are bad, incomplete, or simply don't work. So, I decided to annotate my attempt at getting this to work completely and share them with the world. This example should outline everything you need to build a react project utilizing hooks for state management in react using the default template settings.

If you follow through the code (and potentially the outline in this readme when I get around to writing it) you'll learn
1. How to create a context
2. How to write a reducer
3. How to pass states down to child components
4. How to dispatch actions from child components to the reducer
